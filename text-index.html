<h1>A California Winery</h1>
<p>Dedicated to quality wines for three generations, we offer a selection of classic varietals to last:  Merlot, Syrah, Cabernet Sauvignon, Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Chenin Blanc, and more. </p>
<p>Quality, taste, and reliability are paramount to Dove Farms Wines and Vineyards. Traditional methods and modern viticulture combine to bring you distinctive wines that can be enjoyed now or improved through age. Dove Farms produces more than 18,000 cases of wine from 100 acres of vineyards and has been repeatedly recognized for excellence in national wine competitions. In 2005, Dove Farms won the Best California Winery award from <a href="#">WineTaster magazine</a>.</p>
<p>Come visit us, take a tour of our vineyards, visit our Swan pond, and taste our wines in one of three wine-tasting rooms. Our beautiful, family-owned and operated winery is open every day from 11-6 daily except major holidays.  </p>
<p>We'll even ship special orders anywhere in the U.S. free of charge (under $50) because we so appreciate your visit. And if you are using our wine to honor a special occasion, we are elated to be a part of your momentous day.</p>
