<h1>News</h1>
<p>We are gearing up for a gorgeous summer here at Dove Farms. We are in talks with contractors on expanding our Tudor mansion and building a roof deck so that our visitors can enjoy our wines while overlooking Paso Robles. Look for this expansion some time next year.</p>
<p>In January we opened up a small gift shop in the main lobby area, that is now operated and managed by my daughter, Jamie. Dove Farms Wine Club Members will receive 10% off any item in our gift shop.</p>
<p>Dove Farms wine club members, be a part of our monthly emails. Once a month you will receive an email from Dove Farms with special offers such as even greater discounts. We thank you again for your continued patronage and support. It is our pleasure to serve you. As always, we welcome your feedback and inquiries.</p>
<p>To a joyous summer!</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>
<p>Dan Diamonte</p>
