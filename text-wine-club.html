<h1>Wine Club</h1>
<p>We would love for you to join the Dove Farms Wine Club. Three times a year we will send you:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A shipment of two bottles of Dove Farms wine  (types of wines may vary but you can select your preference when you mail in your membership form)</li>
  <li>A beautiful coffee-table wine book from Paso Robles Printing Press</li>
  <li>A newsletter from our winery</li>
  <li>Membership card with a 15 percent discount on every bottle of our wines</li>
  <li>Invites to private wine parties hosted by the Diamonte family at our gorgeous, 100-acre Napa estate</li>
  <li>A recipe cookbook from Dove Farms with a list of meals best served with our wines</li>
</ul>
<p>Dove Farms Wine Club members will also receive 10 percent off any wines purchased via our secure Web site. We accept Visa, Mastercard, Discover, American Express and Diner's Club.</p>
<p>The annual cost of the Dove Farms Wine Club is $300. The credit card you select to keep on file with us will be billed ten days prior to the shipment of your wine; so you don't have to pay the $300 upfront &#8211; you can pay off the membership over the year. There are no membership dues and you are free to cancel anytime.</p>
<p>To join our wine club, feel free to email us at <a href="mailto:info@dovevalley.com">info@dovevalley.com</a> or call 1-800-DOVE-VLY. We will send you membership applications.</p>
